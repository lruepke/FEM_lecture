Further readings
----------------

There are many good online resources on numerical modeling in marine geosciences:

- The CIG website `<https://geodynamics.org>`_
- Website of the community code ASPECT  `<https://aspect.geodynamics.org>`_
- Marc Spiegelmann's script on numerical methods  `<https://earth.usc.edu/~becker/teaching/557/reading/spiegelman_mmm.pdf>`_ 


There are also a number of books that are really helpful:

- Guy Simpson's book on FE with Matlab `<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119248644>`_
- Hughes classic book on FEM `<https://books.google.de/books/about/The_Finite_Element_Method.html?id=yarmSc7ULRsC&redir_esc=y>`_
- Reddy and Gartling's book `<https://books.google.de/books?id=sv0VKLL5lWUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false>`_ 

Credits
